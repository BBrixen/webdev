                <p>This is a simple, 2D boid simulation. Boids are supposed to mimic birds flocking</p>

                <p>This creates multiple points in 2D space which are attracted towards each other.
                    Depending on the speed and acceleration, this can generate orbits which can look 
                    like electrons circling a nucleus (under the right conditions)</p>

                <a href="./spreading_triangles/spreading_triangles.html">Triangle Gradient</a>
                <p>This creates multiple points in 2D space which lightly repel each other. 
                    We then connect the points using Delaunay triangluation. Now that we have a grid of triangles, 
                    we can apply different color gradients.</p>

                <p>This simulates how ant colonies find food using pheromone trails. </p>
